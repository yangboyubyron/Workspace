(@) ###What is **Kruskal-Wallis test** ?

#
      Kruskal-Wallis test by rank is a non-parametric alternative to one-way ANOVA test, 
      which extends the two-samples Wilcoxon test in the situation where there are more than two groups. 
      It’s recommended when the assumptions of one-way ANOVA test are not met.

(@) ###Visualize your data and compute **Kruskal-Wallis test**

+ ####Import your data into R

Here, we’ll use the built-in R data set named `PlantGrowth{datasets}`. 
It contains the **weight** of plants obtained under a **control** and **two different treatment conditions**.

```{r eval=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
  my_data <- PlantGrowth
```


+ ####Check your data

```{r eval=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
  # print the head of the file
  head(my_data)
```

#
      In R terminology, the column “group” is called factor and the different categories (“ctr”, “trt1”, “trt2”) 
      are named factor levels. 
      
      The levels are ordered alphabetically.

```{r eval=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
  # Show the group levels
  levels(my_data$group)
```

If the levels are **not automatically** in the **correct** order, **re-order** them as follow :

```{r eval=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
  my_data$group <- ordered(my_data$group, levels = c("ctrl", "trt1", "trt2"))
```

#
      It is possible to compute summary statistics by groups.
      The {dplyr} package can be used.

```{r eval=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
  library(dplyr, quietly = TRUE)

  group_by(my_data, group) %>%
      summarise(
          count  = n(),
          mean   = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
          sd     = sd(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
          median = median(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
          IQR    = IQR(weight, na.rm = TRUE)
      )
```


+ ####Visualize the data using **box plots**

Visualize your data with **{ggpubr}** :

```{r eval=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
  # Box plots
  # ++++++++++++++++++++

  # Plot weight by group and color by group
  library("ggpubr", quietly = TRUE)

  ggboxplot(my_data, 
            x = "group", 
            y = "weight", 
            color = "group", 
            palette = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800", "#FC4E07"),
            order = c("ctrl", "trt1", "trt2"),
            ylab = "Weight", 
            xlab = "Treatment"
        )
  
  # Mean plots
  # ++++++++++++++++++++
  # Plot weight by group
  # Add error bars: mean_se
  # (other values include: mean_sd, mean_ci, median_iqr, ....)
  library("ggpubr", quietly = TRUE)
  
  ggline(my_data, 
         x = "group", 
         y = "weight", 
         add = c("mean_se", "jitter"), 
         order = c("ctrl", "trt1", "trt2"),
         ylab = "Weight", 
         xlab = "Treatment")
```


+ ####Compute **Kruskal-Wallis test**

#
      We want to know if there is any significant difference between the average weights of plants 
      in the 3 experimental conditions.

The test can be performed using the function `kruskal.test{stats}` as follow :

```{r eval=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
  kruskal.test(weight ~ group, data = my_data)
```


+ ####Interpret

As the **p-value** is less than the **significance level** 0.05, 
we can conclude that there are **significant differences** between the **treatment groups**.


+ ####**Multiple pairwise-comparison** between **groups**

From the **output** of the **Kruskal-Wallis test**, we know that there is a **significant difference** between **groups**, 
but we **don’t know** which **pairs of groups** are **different**.

It’s **possible** to use the function `pairwise.wilcox.test{stats}` to calculate **pairwise comparisons** 
between **group levels** with **corrections** for **multiple** testing.

```{r eval=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
  pairwise.wilcox.test(PlantGrowth$weight, PlantGrowth$group, p.adjust.method = "BH")
```

#
      The pairwise comparison shows that, only trt1 and trt2 are significantly different (p < 0.05).
