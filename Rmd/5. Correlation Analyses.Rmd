#
    This chapter contains articles for computing and visualizing correlation analyses in R. Recall that, correlation analysis is used to investigate the association between two or more variables. A simple example, is to evaluate whether there is a link between maternal age and childâ€™s weight at birth.
   
(@) ####Correlation Test Between **Two** Variables
    * Brief outline:  
      1\) What is correlation test?  
      2\) Methods for correlation analyses  
      3\) **Correlation formula**  
      4\) **Pearson** correlation formula  
      5\) **Spearman** correlation formula  
      6\) **Kendall** correlation formula  
      7\) Compute **correlation** in R  
      8\) R functions  
      9\) Import your data into R  
      10\) Visualize your data using scatter plots  
      11\) Preliminary test to check the test **assumptions**  
      12\) **Pearson correlation test**  
      13\) **Kendall rank correlation test**  
      14\) **Spearman rank correlation coefficient**

(@) ####Correlation Matrix: Analyze, Format and Visualize
    * Correlation matrix is used to analyze the correlation between multiple variables at the same time.
    * Brief outline:  
      1\) What is correlation matrix?  
      2\) Compute correlation matrix in R  
      3\) R functions  
      4\) Compute correlation matrix  
      5\) Correlation matrix with significance levels (p-value)  
      6\) A simple function to format the correlation matrix  
      7\) Visualize correlation matrix  
          + Use symnum() function: Symbolic number coding
          + Use corrplot() function: Draw a correlogram
          + Use chart.Correlation(): Draw scatter plots
          + Use heatmap()

(@) ####Visualize Correlation Matrix using Correlogram
    * Correlogram 
        - is a graph of correlation matrix. 
        - Useful to highlight the most correlated variables in a data table.      
    * In this plot, correlation coefficients are colored according to the value. 
    * Correlation matrix can be also reordered according to the degree of association between variables.
    * Brief outline:  
      1\) Install R corrplot package  
      2\) Data for correlation analysis  
      3\) Computing correlation matrix  
      4\) Correlogram : Visualizing the correlation matrix  
      5\) Visualization methods  
      6\) Types of correlogram layout  
      7\) Reordering the correlation matrix  
      8\) Changing the color of the correlogram  
      9\) Changing the color and the rotation of text labels  
      10\) Combining correlogram with the significance test  
      11\) Customize the correlogram  
      
```{r code1, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(corrplot)
library(RColorBrewer)

M <-cor(mtcars)
corrplot(M, type="upper", order="hclust", col=brewer.pal(n=8, name="RdYlBu"))
```

(@) ####Elegant Correlation Table using xtable R Package
    * The aim of this article is to show you how to get the lower and the upper triangular part of a correlation matrix. 
    * We will use also xtable R package to display a nice correlation table.
    * Brief outline:  
      1\) Correlation matrix analysis  
      2\) Lower and upper triangular part of a correlation matrix  
      3\) Use xtable R package to display nice correlation table in html format  
      4\) Combine matrix of correlation coefficients and significance   levels
