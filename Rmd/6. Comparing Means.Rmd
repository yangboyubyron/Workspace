+ ###This chapter describes statistical tests to use for comparing means.

- ###These tests include:  
    (1) T-test  
    (2) Wilcoxon test  
    (3) ANOVA test and  
    (4) Kruskal-Wallis test  
    
(@) ###How this chapter is organized?

#
        1. Comparing one-sample mean to a standard known mean:
            (1) One-Sample T-test (parametric)
            (2) One-Sample Wilcoxon Test (non-parametric)
          
        2. Comparing the means of two independent groups:
            (1) Unpaired Two Samples T-test (parametric)
            (2) Unpaired Two-Samples Wilcoxon Test (non-parametric)
            
        3. Comparing the means of paired samples:
            (1) Paired Samples T-test (parametric)
            (2) Paired Samples Wilcoxon Test (non-parametric)
            
        4. Comparing the means of more than two groups
            (1) Analysis of variance (ANOVA, parametric):
                - One-Way ANOVA Test in R
                - Two-Way ANOVA Test in R
                - MANOVA Test in R: Multivariate Analysis of Variance
            (2) Kruskal-Wallis Test in R (non-parametric alternative to one-way ANOVA)
